Hi there! My name is **Candice Cao**, currently a junior computer science student at UCB. This website is dedicated to my hobbies: *cooking, baking* (which means I will put every single one of my recipes in it), *running, hiking, iceskating* (which means part of it will probably be beautiful pictures of the nature), and *more*!! 

And yeah, the website is still "under construction" (a.k.a not finished...), but I'm looking forward to how it will turn out to be!!
