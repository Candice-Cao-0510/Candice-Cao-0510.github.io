Hi there! My name is **Candice Cao**, currently a junior computer science student at UCB. This website is dedicated to my hobbies, lifestyle posts and journals: *cooking, baking* (which means I will put my recipes in it), *exercising, going outdoor* (so also stay tuned on beautiful pictures of the nature), and *more*!! 

And yeah, the website is still "under construction" (a.k.a not finished...), but I'm excited to see how it will turn out!
